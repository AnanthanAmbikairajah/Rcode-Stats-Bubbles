## Introduction to the snow vole dataset

For these exercises we will use some published data, freely available from the Dryad repository:
Bonnet, T & Postma, E (2018). Data from: Fluctuating selection and its (elusive) evolutionary consequences in a wild rodent population. Dryad Digital Repository. [https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6767m](https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6767m).

For some context, these data are from the long-term monitoring of a population of snow voles (_Chionomys nivalis_) in the Swiss Alps.

We will use only the file "Phenotypic data" or "YearPheno.txt".

What exactly the variables are is not crucial, but will help make sense of the exercises:

* ID: focal individual unique identifier
* animal: duplicate of ID to fit relatedness matrices in animal model
* Mother: mother of the focal individual
* Year: year of measurement
* Sex: Female or male
* Age: Juvenile or adult
* BMI: Body mass index. Check the publication for details
* RJst: Standardized relative Julian day 
* RJ2st: Squared Standardized relative Julian day
* Phi and PhiZ: survival to the next year (duplicated for historical reasons)
* RhoZ: reproduction on the next year
* FitnessZ: RhoZ + 2Phi. Check the publication for details
* GGImm: proportion of assumed immigrant ancestry used to fit genetic groups. Check the publication for details
* BMIst: BMI standardized within years
* BMI1 and BMI2: BMI in years of positive or negative selection.
