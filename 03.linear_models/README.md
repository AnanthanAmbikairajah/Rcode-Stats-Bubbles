# Linear models

In a first part we will present some fundamental ideas behind statistical modeling.
The second part is an introduction to linear models.

You can get the slides here [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/blob/master/03.linear_models/slides/slideslinearmodels.pdf](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/blob/master/03.linear_models/slides/slideslinearmodels.pdf) .

Some exercises require the datasets present in the folder [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/tree/master/03.linear_models/DataSets](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/tree/master/03.linear_models/DataSets).

You can download a zip version containing data and slides here  [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/blob/master/03.linear_models/DataSets_Slides.zip](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles/blob/master/03.linear_models/DataSets_Slides.zip).

If needed I will send them by email during the workshop or circulate them on USB.
