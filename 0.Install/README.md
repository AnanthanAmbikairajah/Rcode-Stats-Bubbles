# Installing R and RStudio

You will need to install *R* on your laptop.

Although not strictly necessary, installing *RStudio* is strongly suggested, and the workshops will be prepared assuming that you run R from RStudio.

If you experience difficulties with the installation(s), email me and I will do my best to assist.
