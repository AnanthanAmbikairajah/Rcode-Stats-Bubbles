## Power analysis and linear mixed models.

_Have you ever wished you had collected more data after getting an inconclusive statistical result?_
_Have you wondered what to do with the non-significant fruit of your hard work?_

In this sessions we discuss how to use simulations in R to:
1) Plan experiments and data collection to ensure you can detect an effect if it is there, and do not waste your efforts with work leading to inconclusive results (that is, power analysis)
2) Tell whether "non-significant" results are likely a sign of a poor experimental design (see point 1 :p) or of an effect that is biologically unimportant.

Thinking about these questions will naturally introduce random effect and linear mixed models.

Please install the package lme4 (and if you are interested in using other packages for mixed models, you can also bring MCMCglmm, brms, glmmTMB... or whatever is your favorite (although we might not be able to help as much with more exotic packages) ).

The workshop is on Friday 1, from 10 to 12, in the ecology meeting room (Robertson 3rd floor).

Here is a teaser and exercise about estimating statistical power:
