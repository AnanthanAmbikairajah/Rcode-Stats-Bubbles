\textit{There are many ways to achieve the same goal in \texttt{R}, and we do not claim to teach you the most efficient way to use \texttt{R}. If you at some point during the computer practicals encounter a code that you could make more efficient or elegant, please do let us know! \\[1.5ex] 
Do try to understand exactly what the code and the functions we use do. The best way to learn how functions work is by either using the \texttt{R}-manaul (type \texttt{?functionname} or use the RStudio Help tab by clicking on it or pressing F1) or by creating dummy data (just make up a small amount of data yourself, using \texttt{R} if possible!) and analyse what the function does to this data.}

\section*{How this document works}
This is a \texttt{knitr} document, which knits \texttt{R} code and output within a \LaTeX document.
R code and output is generally contained within boxes with a gray background. Comments within the R code start with a \# symbol; lines with R-outputs start with \#\#.

All the files necessary to go through the workshop are (or should be!) in the folder of a github repository. We recommand you copy these files, or fork the repository if you are a git user.

Now, let's the fun begin.

\section{Trash your calculator}
\subsection{Operators}
\texttt{R} can be used as a calculator, and a far more powerful one that any physical calculator. If you use your calculator to enter numbers in \texttt{R}, you are being inefficient.

Below we demonstrate the use of some basic mathematical operators:
<<mathope>>=
1+3 #addition
5-2 #substraction
6*4 #multiplication
14/2 #division
2^3 #exponent
2**3 #or equivalently
@

There are many mathematical functions already present in R:
<<mathfun>>=
exp(3) #exponential
log(2.71) #logarithm
sqrt(9) #square root, which of course you can also write as:
9 ^ (1/2)
sin(pi/2); cos(1); tan(pi/3) #trigonometric functions
@

\textbf{Small exercise}
Use R to compute
$$
  y = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{-1}{2} (\frac{3-\pi}{2})^2}
$$

<<echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE>>=
(1/(2*sqrt(2*pi))) * exp((-1/2)*((3-pi)/2)^2)
@

\end{mdframed}

Logical operators are very important for programming and scripting.
You can test whether two things are equal with double = signs:
<<logop>>=
3 == 6/2 #is 3 equal to 6/2? TRUE!
3 == pi  # FALSE!
@

You can also test if they are NOT equal with the operator \texttt{!=}:
<<>>=
2 != 3
2 != 2
@

The AND operator is \texttt{\&}
<<>>=
2 == 2 & 3==3
2 ==2 & 3==2
@

The OR operator is \texttt{\textbar}
<<>>=
2 == 2 | 3==2
2 == 4 | 3==2
@
