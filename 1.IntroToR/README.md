# Basic introduction to R

In this folder, you will find a brief introduction to R.
If you are already familiar with R, you might find this quite boring and might be better off skipping it.

Before looking at this tutorial, you should install R, and (not strictly necessary, but recommended) R-Studio. During the tutorial, you will need an Internet connection to install packages you have not installed yet.
Contact us if you have difficulties with these.

Topics covered include:
* R operators (assignment, basic algebra...)
* Containers (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists...)
* Simple graphics
* Package management
* Writing functions
